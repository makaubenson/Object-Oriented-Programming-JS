# Object Oriented Programming -JS

- OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on concept of objects.
- We use objects to model real world abstract features.
- Objects can have properties and methods.
- Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another.
- These interactions happen through a public interface(API)
- OOP was build with goal of organizing code.

## Classes

- Blueprint from which we can create new objects.

## Instance

- Object created through class.
- Real object created from class.

## Fundamental Principles Guiding model real world data into classes

- There are 4 fundamental principles guiding these:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Abstraction

- Ignore or hide details that don't matter.

### Encapsulation

- Keeping properties and methods private inside a class so that they are not accessible outside the class.
- Some methods can however be exposed as a public interface (API)

### Inheritance

- Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming hierachical relationship between classes.

- Goal is to reuse logic that is common to both classes.
- The child class, can have its own methods and properties apart from those inherited.

### Polymorphism

- A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.
